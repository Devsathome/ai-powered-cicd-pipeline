## üöÄ Current Status - Milestone 1: Application Containerization

The project has successfully completed its first milestone. The primary goal was to take a simple web application and package it into a standardized, portable unit using Docker.

**Key Achievements in this Milestone:**

*   Developed a basic web application using Python and the Flask framework.
*   Authored a `Dockerfile` that defines the steps to build a runnable image of the application.
*   Successfully troubleshot dependency and networking issues within the Docker build process.
*   The application is now fully containerized, ensuring it can run consistently on any machine with Docker.
*   The initial code, including the application source and `Dockerfile`, has been pushed to this GitHub repository.
